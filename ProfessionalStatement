Seasoned risk-management professional—17 years at a Fortune 100 insurer—pivoting into cybersecurity with a deep commitment to justice and helping people live safe, secure lives. 

I leverage strategic problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and relationship-building.
I’m actively developing: 
  Expertise in threat detection and incident response (SIEM, CERT methodologies)
  Proficiency in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (CompTIA Security+, CISSP)
  SQL and database security skills (secure query development, database monitoring and hardening)

I aim to use these values in combination with my decade of risk management experience, existing skills and recently developed skills to help cybersecurity teams design and implement best practices to protect—and empower—organizations and their people.
